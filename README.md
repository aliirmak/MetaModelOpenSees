# Meta Modeling for OpenSees
OpenSees, the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation, is an open-source finite element tool that has advanced capabilities for modeling and analyzing linear and nonlinear response of structural and geotechnical systems using a wide range of material models, elements, and solution algorithms. OpenSees is a text-based program and users develop their models by writing scripts in Tcl and employing commands special to OpenSees. The commands for scripts are specific to structural and geotechnical domains. Users can define variables such as geometry, boundary conditions, section size of structural elements, material and behavior of the elements, damping ratios, solvers, input excitations, and many more.

This project seeks to add a basic support to WebGME to run OpenSees models. Using the model-integrated approach, OpenSees models can be now used multiple times to run different simulations. The tool is especially useful for visualizing a structural model instead of using script which may be challenging for first year undergraduate studetens who want to learn how structures are working but don't know how to start.
